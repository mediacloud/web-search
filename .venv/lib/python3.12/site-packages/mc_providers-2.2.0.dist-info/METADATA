Media Cloud Providers Library
=============================

A package of search providers for Media Cloud, wrapping up interfaces for different social media platform.

UNDER CONSTRUCTION- Probably won't get a huge amount of attention for a little bit, but I'm putting this 
up now since I've done this extraction already.

Install with pip (`pip install .`) and the `install.sh` script. 

Requires environment variables set for various interfaces to work correctly.
