# Media Cloud Web Search and Source Management App

ðŸš§ **under construction** ðŸš§

This is the new Media Cloud search application. It is intended to support online media research across platforms such
as online news, Twitter, Reddit, and other social media (via 3rd party APIs). We also use it to manage a large set of
geographical and topical content collections, supporting research into specific sub-corpora of content on those
platforms.

_Expected to launch publicly in early 2023_
