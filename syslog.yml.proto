# config file for mcweb/backend/utils/syslog-sink.py
# (run under Dokku to collect and write log messages
# to auto-rotated log files in /app/data/logs)

# syslog.yml.proto is copied to data/logs/syslog.yml and
# data/logs/syslog.yml.proto by install.sh (on app build) when the top
# level copy differs from the one in data/logs

# syslog-sink periodically checks for changes to data/logs/syslog.yml
# But (see above) local changes will not survive changes to the
# checked in version of the file!

# see
#  https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging-config-dictschema
# for the structure of this file!

# NOTE!!! logging.config.dictConfig is NOT verbose about errors that
# happen when configuring handlers and loggers (any extraneous or
# missing arguments will cause heartache and will NOT be seen) so be
# careful!

# Formatting should have been done on sender side
# (has more data to work with and want ACTUAL time of event)

# web-search log handlers that send messages here are created using
# mc.settings function add_syslog_handler and must have a unique
# integer facility code.

# SysLogHandler used to send messages here preserves the original
# message priority, the "level" setting here determines whether the
# messages are logged (providing the logger in the originator was ALSO
# so configured!).
